# Bechdel-Wallace Bot
# Overview
This machine-learning algorithm uses weights obtained from a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a film will pass the [Bechdel-Wallace test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) based on the film's number of male characters, number of female characters, release year, and its inflation-adjusted gross revenue. 
# Tech Used/Dependencies 
- Backend/Frontend connection done with Flask API
- Model trained by [Polygraphâ€™s study of films by gender](https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts) as well as [Bechdeltest.com's](https://bechdeltest.com/) database of movies that did and did not pass the Bechdel test.
- Data fit to logistic regression model in Matlab. Formulas learned in Professor Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.
